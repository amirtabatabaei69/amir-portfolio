              Iâ€™m a hard working and dedicated professional front-end developer
              with a keen eye for detail, and a determination to deliver the
              very highest quality. I take great pride in my work, and I always
              try to better myself with every project I work on. I like to write
              semantic, cross browser compatible code by hand that is
              re-useable, maintainable and easy to understand. I am motivated,
              enthusiastic and well organised. The main areas of my expertise
              are HTML(5), CSS(3) and JavaScript (native and jQuery) but I have
              basic knowledge of React and Redux.
